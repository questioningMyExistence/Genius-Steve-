# Summary

Steve Rogers was a genius snarky kid who worked as lab assistant in Dr.Erskine's lab. But Dr. Erskine was sad that the kid won't survive for long. He had seen some of the theories kid worked on during lunch break or other free time. They were ground breaking. Evenmore so, Steve was kind and not-confrontational. He was not a coward by any stretch of the imagination. But he had rather keep to himself than engage in a useless fight. After at one such incident of his kindness, Dr. Erskine decided Steve Rogers was a genius who didn't deserve to die so early of illnesses. And if anyone was fit for the serum it was Steve. THAT is how Steven Grant Rogers ended up helping Dr. Erskine develop the serum and then become Captain America.

What happens when this genius, snarky, and kind Captain America wakes up in the future? Read the fic to find out.

Or the MCU Captain America with real character development that we all wanted but never got.

He forced his brain to hit the brakes, to just stop and focus on the now. Overthinking was a surefire way to give himself a migraine—though, if he was honest, that train had left the station a long time ago.

"Sort of. They’re putting together a squad. The PR spin? A team of extraordinary folks taking on battles beyond anyone else’s league,” Steve replied, accepting a plate. “Think of it as the Howling Commandos, but with a serious upgrade.”

“And what’s the real deal?” Matt prodded between mouthfuls.

---

"Agent Coulson. My bad, I was half-expecting a guy named Robert Downey to show up." 

---

"You're mistaken, Captain. The other guy's not someone you chat with—he's a monster. Perpetually angry."

---

"Hey Metal Mogul, if you are done, can we take Horns Mcgee over there under arrest?" Steve says as he comes to Tony. "You know unless you intend to fly him to prison in that suit princess style?"

---

"What's wrong with this guy?" Tony asks Loki pointing at Steve.

"Give me a break, I only just killed a guy and gauged his eyeball out." Loki says, rolling his eyes and shrugging. "But that said; Captain, is there something that's wrong with you?"

---

"Yoga and meditation every Monday and Tuesday. Pilates every Wednesday and Thursday." Steve replies, unfazed.

"What's on the long weekend."

"Oh, you know..." Steve says, wiggling his eyebrows.

Tony picks Thor up, bridal style.

"Sleeping Thunder." Steve finds himself saying. "What?" Tony asks. "I would have gone with the nickname Sleeping Thunder you know, from the sleeping beauty and all the lightning."

# Chapter-1: Waking Up

Steve snapped back to reality, shaking off the last bits of his dream. His head was pounding, and he felt off, like he hadn’t eaten in forever. He tried to stretch out the kinks in his muscles, but man, did it hurt. No way he could run or fight like he used to. ‘Looks like I’m playing the strongman today,’ he thought. Not his first choice, but if he was in enemy territory, he’d have to make do.

Next, he tried to get a sense of where he was by listening.

“Workman’s up to bat for the Phillies, swinging that bat like he means business. Chipman’s on the mound, throws a curve—misses the plate. That’s ball one.”

‘Chipman? But they traded him…’ It clicked for Steve. The game on the radio was old news, probably a trick to make him think everything was normal. He pushed his hearing further, past the fake calm of the broadcast. The chatter he picked up sounded military, but not quite right. They were talking missions, sneaky stuff, the kind of words you hear in spy movies. And then there was the noise—more than he’d ever heard, even in Stark’s loudest workshops. Horns, engines, sirens. That means that he is either in a very large and high tech base, or he is in a metropolitan city. The second option seems more likely, but this much noise means that time has advanced rather agressively. More than he might have first guessed. He knew the direction industrialization was taking. He knew that the noise was going to increase. If that is true, then he must have been in a coma for at least 30 years.

Losing his patience, Steve finally opened his eyes. He’d figured out as much as he could without tipping them off. He sat up and took a good look around. ‘They’re trying to pull a fast one on me,’ he realized. They didn’t want him to know when or where he was.

“Good morning,” a voice said. Steve turned to see a dame in an SSR uniform, putting away the Brooklyn Eagle. He checked out the paper—the feel, the print—and her getup, the stitching and the badge. Either he’d seriously miscalculated how fast things were moving, or he was at least 50 years ahead of his time. “Or should I say afternoon,” she added, trying to look all innocent.

Steve’s brain kicked into overdrive, trying to come up with a plan on the spot, even though he was running on empty. He made up his mind quick, stood up to leave, but then some guy walked in with metal cuffs. ‘So we’re doing this the hard way,’ Steve figured. He didn’t hold back, using his strength to break free. He bolted out of the building as fast as he could to scope out the place.

Steve’s gaze swept over the landscape, and it hit him like a ton of bricks—he was in the future. Cars zipped by at breakneck speeds, skyscrapers clawed at the heavens, and everything had a sheen to it, like the whole city had just been polished. Folks were milling about, using portable devices, he could see the STARK logo if he really focused his eyes. He spotted a couple of diners and coffee shops dotting the streetscape, neon signs winking in broad daylight. It was all so… futuristic. He slipped into an alley, figuring it’d only be a matter of time before the suits from the agency caught up.

“At ease, soldier,” came a voice from behind, snapping Steve out of his thoughts. He spun around to face a guy who looked like he’d just walked off a pirate ship—eyepatch and all.

“Who are you?”

“Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD. Back in your day, we were the Strategic Scientific Reserve.” Steve kept quiet, giving him the floor. “Apologies for the theatrics earlier. We’ve never dealt with anything like your situation before. Didn’t know if your mind could handle the shock, so we opted for a slow reveal.”

Steve’s internal BS detector went off. ‘Nice try,’ he thought. Nobody puts on a show like that just to ease someone into the truth. They had an angle, sure, but what? And why the charade? A supersoldier like him had plenty of uses, that much was clear. But the shackles? That answer came too easily. He forced his brain to hit the brakes, to just stop and focus on the now. Overthinking was a surefire way to give himself a migraine—though, if he was honest, that train had left the station a long time ago.

“Break what?” Steve finally asked, his voice steady.

"You've been asleep, Captain. For almost seventy years." Okaayyy... So that was slightly higher than his estimate. 

Seventy years. The number echoed in Steve’s head, bouncing around with a mix of disbelief and a strange sense of loss. He took another look around, the future sprawling out before him—a tapestry of honking cars that moved like bullets, towering buildings that scraped the sky, and people who seemed to live through their shiny little devices. “The world of the future,” he muttered, the words slipping out before he could catch them.

"Well, thanks to you, there is one." The words were meant to be reassuring, but Steve’s gut twisted. He’d been around enough smooth talkers to recognize flattery laced with intent. He filed that away for later and pressed on, “How am I alive?”

"To be perfectly honest, we’re not sure yet. My docs say it’s some kind of suspended animation. Dr. Erskine’s formula, the extreme cold...I can’t break it down for you on a cellular level, but you haven’t aged a day since that plane went down."

That was a lot to take in. Good news, in a way, but it also meant he’d missed out on a lifetime. His friends, his world—they were history now. Sure, waking up in the 1940s would’ve been simpler, more familiar. But this future, with its dazzling tech and discoveries he could only dream of, held a bittersweet allure. 

"I know it’s a lot to swallow. But the world’s not as different as it looks. There’s still work to be done..." pointedly, Fury says, "Soldier’s work."

That was a puzzle for Steve, a challenge. He’d missed out on decades of progress, of friendships, of life. But here was an opportunity to dive into a world of discovery that would have been unimaginable in his time. The tech, the science, the sheer volume of knowledge to catch up on—it was daunting, but Steve Rogers had never been one to shy away from a challenge.

# Chapter-2: Exploring the modern world

This chapter is a little hard to write. Like, I know what I want to cover but an inspiration regarding detailed scenes hasn't yet struck. So for now, I'll just give a brief outline of this chapter and move on to next one:

- Steve meets the Parkers.
- Steve meets Jessica Jones.
- Steve meets Murdock and Nelson.

# Chapter-3: Roll Call

Steve goes to sit on the park bench with a sketchpad in his hand. His schedule over the past three months has been the same, library, art classes, gym, repeat. He likes coming at the park before classes, sitting down and just drawing a random object while he lets the bluster of city wash over him. 

He has been catching up. The world of science hasn't changed as much as he expected to in the last 50 years, but its application into engineering and tech have become much more prominent. He's also been learning coding at night. Trying to understand the computer architecture that has been created. The system and prtocols behind the internet that run the digital world, are a work of genius and quite unimaginable. He never would have thought that this would be the future in 40's. Going to the moon and mars... sure, but a network of interconnected devices to ensure seemless flow of information throughout the world... okay, when you put it like that he can see the practicality behind it, but still. It's not quite something that one would have imagined Howard going into. For now though, he's fine with just sitting down, relaxing and putting his perspective of the world on the sketchpad after a long day of studies.

He then hears the faint rustling of leather and guns and he sighs. It seems like today won't be that day. So he closes his sketchpad and looks up just as the eye spy chief settles down beside him.

"Don't you find this peace disillusioning?" Fury asked. "As of right this moment, there are more than a dozen wars happening around the world. People are being killed and massacred everyday, and yet, here these people are guilelessly living through and enjoying life, when a simple show of there concern could revolutionize world in an election cycle."

"Ignorance is bliss." Steve said, easily recalling the now 170 year old poem, even as he thought over Fury's word, confused. This wasn't the true Fury, he knew that much from all the hacking he had done into SHIELD servers. So what was Fury playing at? What did he wanted to show? "Is SHIELD looking to lift that viel of ignorance?"

"We work in secrecy Captain, trying our damn hardest to keep the general people ignorant. And I think you know that." Fury said.

"Protection against extraterrestrial and extraordinary threats. The ones normal people would have no hope of controlling or fighting." Steve said. Repeating the shield's PR spiel from before. What SHIELD didn't realize was that the definition of normal was changing.

Fury raised his eyebrows, impressed. "I see that you are already integrating into SHIELD. We could use someone like you, war isn't over yet Captain."

Steve gave his practiced Captain America smile. The first lesson when dealing with idiots, act dumb and make them think you're a friend. "I would love nothing more than going to the frontlines. Tell me you have a mission report for me?"

Fury then slid a folder to him. It first contained the photo of the cube that he had seen red skull holding. "Hydra's secret weapon." Steve stated.

"Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs." Fury said.

Steve’s internal alarm bells rang. ‘Bull,’ he thought. While he knew that Howard had diversified his business early on to medicine and oil in the 50's and then computers in 70's, he also knew that Howard had done a lot of work to fight the cold war. Nukes were all the rage back then, and once the nuclear peace treaty was signed, Howard would have definitely been looking at the next big bomb to design with all the free time in his hands. Not that he had anything to say against it. Nuclear deterrents worked, as far as he had read about the cold war.

"Who took it from you?" Steve asked instead.

Fury shrugged. "The guy’s name is Loki. Asgardian, and yeah, kind of a prince. He’s got our top dozen playing puppet to his tune." He glanced around the park, looking at kids playing, a sardonic smile flickering. "The kicker? They’ve got the SHIELD playbook memorized. They could turn the place upside down, and we’d be none the wiser—like sitting ducks in a surprise Tarantino flick."

Steve notices the bait. "What's Asgardian?" He asks, ofcourse Steve knows what Asgardian is. He has looked at SHIELD's account of Thor and the Destroyer. But he can't let Fury know he knows.

Steve began to tuck his sketchpad and pencil back into his bag, his movements unhurried. Fury kept talking, undeterred by the action.

"There's a debfriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?"

"You should have left it in the ocean."

---

Steve nudged the door open and stepped into his apartment. The space was modest: a living room greeted him first, with an open kitchen in full view and a bedroom branching off to the side. To his surprise, the kitchen was far from empty. There, amidst the aroma of sizzling snacks, was his friend, the ‘Radar Counselor,’ whipping up a storm of treats to satisfy their superhuman appetites.

Without a word, Steve’s gaze sharpened—a silent signal that screamed, *‘You shouldn't be here, This isn’t safe.’*

Matt didn’t miss a beat. “Relax, I did a sweep for bugs as soon as I got here,” he assured, a hint of mischief in his tone. “Found a whole collection, some real state-of-the-art stuff. You and the kid are going to tear it up in the lab.”

“Why are you here?” Steve’s tone was low as he set his bag down. “I’ve spotted five people staking out this place.” He locked eyes with Matt. “You being here, it’s a risk. They’re tracking my every move.”

Matt’s response was calm. “Make that eight. I wouldn’t have risked it, but Jess was on edge when you missed art class, and then you messaged that you'll be off the grid for the week. Foggy’s been restless. Since Jess and I are the only ones who could slip by unnoticed, I came.”

Steve’s gaze drifted as he recounted, “The neighbor two doors down, always with a fresh batch of cookies, a dead ringer for Peggy. The maintenance guy who takes his sweet time but never slacks off. The jogger who’s more interested in our windows than his workout. The dog walker who’s a little too attentive. And that street musician who never misses a beat.”

Matt chimed in, pointing casually to a window. “Plus, the photographer on the roof with gear that’s overkill for just skyline shots. The freelancer in the coffee shop who’s got a perfect view of this place. And the gardener who’s planting more bugs than flowers.”

Steve gave a nod of respect. “You’ve got a knack for this,” he said, eyeing the folder on the table. He grabbed it and flipped it open as Matt kept busy with the pasta.

Impatience gnawing at him, Steve didn’t bother with niceties; he tore the pages from the folder and laid them out on the table. The serum had supercharged his brain, leaving him restless without a dozen things to juggle. The first six sheets, flung to the far end of the table, detailed the profiles of six Avengers. The next few were deep dives into Loki’s mythological background, and the rest? All about the Tesseract.

“What’s all this?” Matt’s voice pulled Steve’s attention as he approached with two heaping plates of pasta. “Heading out on a SHIELD mission?”

“Sort of. They’re putting together a squad. The PR spin? A team of extraordinary folks taking on battles beyond anyone else’s league,” Steve replied, accepting a plate. “Think of it as the Howling Commandos, but with a serious upgrade.”

“And what’s the real deal?” Matt prodded between mouthfuls.

Steve’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Fury’s playing the long game. He knows this kind of operation needs serious clout and cash, not to mention it’ll grind down the team. He’s piling on the mind games, especially with Stark. Wants us at each other’s throats, too busy scrapping to see the bigger picture. Plans to cut us off from any lifelines, too—no friends, no family to turn to. And he’s planting a couple of his own in the mix to keep us in check.”
"But you're going in anyway," Matt said, more a statement than a question.

Steve leaned back, his eyes not leaving the scattered papers. "SHIELD's got their fingers in too many pies. I need to see what they're cooking up from the inside." He sighed. "They're playing with fire, dealing with stuff from out of this world, and nobody's asking how or why. With all that power and secrecy... it's a recipe for disaster. And if I say no, they'll just come at me harder."

Matt's warning was stern. "Just remember, they've underestimated you. They don't know how sharp you are, think you're just some muscle with a shield. If you play it too smart, tip them off..." He gestured to the papers. "They'll come down on you like a ton of bricks. And once you're out, you better make sure SHIELD's nothing but ashes. Otherwise, they'll never stop hunting you."

Steve nodded, his fork pausing mid-air as he scanned Howard's notes on the Tesseract. Over 80% of it was his handiwork, with Selvig's contributions rounding it out. **'There's more, has to be,'** he thought. **'This is just what they want me to see.'** He decided to open his secret laptop, that was logged into the secret SHIELD tonight as he continues reading the Howard's theories regarding the tesseract being more than an energy source.

Steve's mind flashes back to the Valkyrie. 

---

THE PLANE SEEMS TO VANISH AROUND HIM. VISIONS OF THE NINE REALMS DANCE IN THE LIGHT: A RAINBOW PORTAL STRETCHES PAST AN OBSERVATORY AND INTO SPACE.
RED SKULL: Valhalla... I was right... It is real... Yes, I understand... I have waited so long...

THE VISIONS SPEED UP UNTIL THEY BLUR. SUDDENLY, THE CUBE VIBRATES VIOLENTLY. The Skull looks worried. Something’s wrong.

RED SKULL: No.

STEVE WHIPS UP HIS SHIELD AS ENERGY SHOOTS FROM THE CUBE.

RED SKULL: NO!
ENERGY BOLTS RICOCHET OFF THE CEILING AND STRIKE THE SKULL, VAPORIZING HIM AS... THE CUBE GOES NOVA.

---

"Steeeve... Steeevee... STEVE" Matt's voice jolts him back to present. "Yeah, yeah, umm... I'm sorry. I just... flashed back to the past" Steve says as he stammers and he finds himself sitting on the cold hard ground with Matt kneeled next to him and he looks around and sees that the chair is broken completely. With everything in pieces. He feels hot metal in his hand, he looks to see that he's still holding the spoon, except that the flat handle has now turned into an almost conical shape due to warping from tight clutching from his fingers. The warping was so fast and sharp that the metal heated up in temperature. 

"Do you want to talk about it?" Matt asks.

"No, it's... nothing. Let's get back to the pasta before it gets cold." Steve says.

They resumed eating, the silence stretching between them until Steve broke it. “Red Skull didn’t die that day, you know?” He paused, recalling the vivid memory. “I thought I was seeing things. The Tesseract burned him, but it didn’t kill him. It sent him somewhere else. He mentioned Valhalla, and I saw this… golden planet, and eight others. Earth was one of them, I think.”

“Valhalla?” Matt echoed, his brow furrowing. “Foggy was rambling about that the other day. Something about devils, afterlife, and Asgardian myths.”

“Asgardian?” Steve’s interest piqued as he stood up, plate in hand—pasta first, always. He wandered over to the scattered papers, his eyes scanning the myths of Thor and Loki. His gaze landed on Thor’s description of Asgard and the Nine Realms, recounted to Jane Foster. The observatory, the rainbow bridge—it was all too familiar, just like the vision from his past.

Steve’s eyes flicked back to the Tesseract research, his stomach churning. Portals, Howard’s theories, Selvig’s work—all pointing to teleportation, all needing a power source like a nuclear reactor. His gaze landed on the newspapers, on the mention of Stark Tower. ‘An Arc reactor, maybe?’ His mind raced with the implications for space travel, for resource harvesting, but he wrenched his thoughts back to the present. Dreaming big would have to wait.
“I’ve got a long night ahead,” Steve said, his voice steady despite the storm of thoughts. “You should get the Nelsons, the Mahoneys, the Parkers, the Walkers, the Joneses, and the Leeds out of town for a bit. I’ve got a bad feeling about New York.”

“Why?” Matt’s question was sharp, his focus intense.

“Just a hunch,” Steve replied.

“You’re not one to play hunches. What’s really going on?”

Steve hesitated. “The Tesseract could open portals. It just needs a nuclear reactor, or maybe an Arc reactor.”

Steve’s admission hung in the air, heavy with unspoken fears. Matt’s eyes narrowed, piecing together the gravity of the situation. “That big, huh?” he said slowly, the weight of the implication settling in. A portal was one thing, but Steve’s urgency, his call to evacuate everyone he cared about- painted a stark picture. Matt understood then; this wasn’t just about opening a door to somewhere else. Steve was bracing for whatever might come pouring out of it, something that could threaten all of New York.

Steve caught the shift in Matt’s expression, the realization dawning. “Yeah,” he confirmed, “it’s not just about the portal. It’s about what it means for everyone here. I can’t shake the feeling that we’re on the brink of something that could shake this city to its core.”

Steve looks at Matt. He then looks back at the papers spread around the table. He thinks back to everything he has learned that has happened over the past three years at SHIELD. He then thinks about all those families that accepted him as there own and took care of him. He remembers the light in Peter's eyes, and the kindness in Ben and May Parkers and other families. He remembers all the dinners he has had when he was grateful to not be alone. Determination flashes through him. He won't let them come to harm. None of them were dying on his watch. 

He then looks back at Matt, "I can't tell you why? I don't even know if I know exactly why? But I think it is." Then realizes how little reason he has, and that Matt hasn't actually known him for that long a time. "Look I understand that you can't just upend all your lives and take leave and go on a trip just on my feeling. But atleast remain alert, I'll message you the moment I find a confirmation of my suspicions. But you have to promise me that you'll take everyone away immediately then."

Matt studied him, a long, silent moment passing. “Okay, I’ll do it,” he agreed, a smile breaking through.

“To a quiet week, then,” Steve raised his glass of soda, a toast to the hope that his fears were unfounded.

# Chapter-4: Assembling?

Steve entered his room at 8 PM, aware that he had only three and a half hours before a car would arrive to transport him to SHIELD's new clandestine base. Over the past three hours, he had meticulously combed through every piece of information on the Tesseract, absorbing the contents of the dossier provided by SHIELD. Coupled with his extensive reading, he felt confident enough to consider himself well-versed in thermonuclear astrophysics. Stark's profile lingered in his mind, but he filed it away for later. For now, he concentrated on scanning the room with his enhanced senses. The space was modest, equipped with the basics: a closet, a bed, and an air cooler to combat the oppressive heat. Assured of his privacy, he approached the cooler.

Crouching down, Steve opened the back panel. He deftly placed a slip of paper in the narrow space beneath the motor designed to circulate water through the cooling pads. Next, he retrieved a micro screwdriver kit from his pocket and inserted it into an inconspicuous hole in the motor. A soft clinking sound signaled the release of a key onto the cooler's floor. Removing the paper allowed the key to slide out with it. He then reinserted the key into the same hole, using his superhuman hearing to turn it precisely clockwise and then counterclockwise until a click confirmed the mechanism's release. The small compartment door swung open, and he extracted a thumb drive with two fingers.

The idea was Trish's, inspired by a children's book she cherished. Steve had quickly learned that Trish was an unstoppable force; once she resolved to do something, it was as good as done. He had allowed her to engineer the cooler's hidden compartment, following her instructions to the letter. Although he might have preferred a more ingenious and original approach, he couldn't deny that this along with all self-destructing trigger traps if the procedure was not done correctly were effective.

Inserting the thumb drive into his laptop, Steve activated the small spider-bot. The concept was Peter's brainchild: a diminutive robotic spider, indistinguishable from the real thing, to be deployed within SHIELD's headquarters in D.C. SHIELD boasted a secretive network of servers, spanning the U.S. and Europe, operating independently of the internet. Steve admired the strategy. He had originally intended to place the bot at Triskelion but since he couldn't secretly go to DC and come back, he had to make do with placing it an old run-down base near new york. Its hacking capabilities allowed it to access any server room and connect, providing Steve with a gateway to SHIELD's classified information from anywhere within the U.S.

Simple and efficient—the hallmarks of a flawless plan. Refocusing, Steve set out to gather as much intelligence as possible on the Tesseract. With determination, he began his work.

<!--
So how to play this:
    - Steve enters a car.
    - Meets someone named Robert
    - they have a nice and funny talk about:
        - how long is the way
        - how long has it been since Robert joined
        - where is his family
        - 
        - 

Or Skip this altogether
-->
The clock's nudging 11:30 PM. Steve's a bit rattled after everything he's learned. He tosses a few things into his duffel, knowing full well it'll get a thorough search and he'll be watched like a hawk at SHIELD's new digs. Right on cue, at 11:35 PM, he steps out of the building and slides into the front seat of the waiting car.

"Captain," greets an agent as Steve chucks his bag into the back. He turns and—oh, it's Phil Coulson.

"Agent..." Steve plays it off like he's fishing for the name, even though he's done his homework on the SHIELD crew he's likely to rub shoulders with.

"Coulson. Phil Coulson."

"Agent Coulson. My bad, I was half-expecting a guy named Robert Downey to show up." No real shock there; Steve had pieced together that Coulson would be fetching Tony Stark. And with Brooklyn just a slight detour on the way to Long Beach, plus Coulson's well-known Cap fandom, it adds up that he'd be the one to swing by.

"Plans changed. I was nearby at LaGuardia, figured I'd grab you on my way," Phil explains, then hits him with a question. "You get through that mission briefing yet?"

"Not all the way," Steve admits, a touch sheepish. "Still gotta watch the videos and stuff on the chip."

"No sweat, I'll hook you up with a tablet on the jet," Phil offers, pressing the accelerator as they merge onto the freeway. "So, how's the modern world treating you, Captain?"

Steve's still quietly wowed by the zip and smoothness of today's cars. *Still running on gas, though.* That thought snaps him back just in time to catch Phil's question. "It's a lot to take in," he says, not really dwelling on it as his mind's ticking over other things. "Some stuff's a real surprise, like the Internet. Never figured that'd be a thing. But then there's bits that let me down, you know? Expected some leaps and bounds in different ways, or that some bright ideas from the '40s would've taken off. But all in all, it's not half bad."

"Have you hit up the theater yet? Or maybe Disney World? They've got some killer exhibits, and I think one or two might even feature you," Phil says, a hint of excitement in his voice. "Or taken a spin around New York? There's a ton to see."

Steve's actually done all that. The kids practically dragged him, insisting he couldn't miss out. Those outings pop up in his mind now and then, bringing a stealthy grin to his face. But he's gotta play it close to the vest with Coulson. Damn SHIELD. It irks him, having to dodge sharing these bits of his new life. "Nah, not yet. I'm still acclimating to this time. How about you? How long have you been working for SHIELD?"

"Almost 18 years now" Coulson responds.

"You were with Fury from the beginning?"

Coulson looks startled at that. Surprised that Fury told Rogers when he joined, and the actual truth at that. "Yes, Director Fury and I were partners since the very start of our careers at SHIELD."

"Life outside SHIELD must be a thing, right? Got any favorite haunts?"

They keep the chit-chat rolling, back and forth, as the car eats up the miles to their destination.

---

They touch down at what passes for an airport – more a modest strip of tarmac and a hangar, with the ocean stretching out beyond the beach on the other side.

A quinjet sits poised for departure, engines humming softly. Steve grabs his duffel and follows Coulson aboard.

"This STARK pad's loaded with all the intel," Coulson says, handing over the sleek device. "Take a gander if you want." Steve nods, settling into a seat as Coulson heads off to confer with the pilot.

Steve quickly browses through the videos and articles, taking a note of how they were presented. He had no doubt that Fury would use everything he could to manipulate them. Steve has been catching up with all kinds of news in the past three months. Reading papers for each topic from across the spectrum. He can see that Fury deliberately picked those videos and news articles which made the others look like they were incompetent and selfish, especially Dr. Stark. Since everything about the man was amplified a thousand fold in media, it looked even worse. While his own articles were only the flattering ones.

Midway through a clip of Thor in action, Coulson reappears. "We've got about six hours to base," he announces. "Might as well catch some Z's – big day ahead." Steve hands back the tablet with a nod. "Rest easy, Agent Coulson."

War's taught Steve to sleep on a dime, anywhere, under any conditions. He's not in the clear yet, but he figures SHIELD's done poking and prodding him for now. His eyes shut, and he's out like a light.

---

Steve wakes up to the quiet inside the quinjet, Coulson still catching some shut-eye. He unbuckles and stands to stretch out a bit, careful not to wake him.

Once he’s done, he sits back down, and right on cue, Coulson’s eyes flutter open. “Morning, Agent Coulson,” Steve says with a nod.

Coulson stretches a bit himself. “Morning, Captain,” he replies, and Steve can’t help but feel a twinge at the title. He never completed the training. The title was more of a PR stunt.

Coulson heads up front to chat with the pilot, and Steve grabs the tablet again. He’s got a handle on everyone’s abilities, sure, but he’s trying to suss out SHIELD’s slant on them. The files from last night sparked some hunches; now, these videos are helping him zero in on what Fury’s after.

“We’re about forty minutes out from the base, sir,” the pilot calls out to Coulson.

That catches Steve off guard. He’d figured they were heading to some remote island, not smack in the middle of the Pacific.

Coulson settles back in his seat, turning to Steve with a kind of earnestness. “Gotta say, Captain, it’s a real honor. Your stories were a big part of my childhood. Made me want to be a part of SHIELD.”

Steve looks at him, weighing his words. “Those stories, they weren’t all spot-on,” he admits.

Coulson nods, getting it. “But some parts were true, right? You did save the world.”

Steve lets out a small sigh. “Those stories were meant to inspire, to make kids dream big. But the real deal is, there’ve been billions of folks through history pushing hard to leave something behind. And what I did? It’s just a drop in the ocean compared to many of them.”

Coulson’s expression shifts, a mix of realization and respect. “I might not know the full picture of the war you fought, but I like to think that one person’s fight can light a spark in a whole lot of others.”

The quinjet's wheels kiss the deck just as Coulson finishes his thought, and they both rise to their feet.

"I've got this collection of cards," Coulson starts, a bit hesitant. "It'd mean a lot if you could sign them, if it's not too much trouble—"

"Trading cards?" Steve's interest is piqued. "Sure, I'd be happy to. You got 'em with you?"

Coulson's caught off guard. "Oh—well, yes, but they're back in my room."

"No problem. I've got to drop off my gear at the barracks anyway. I can sign them there," Steve offers, scanning the surroundings as they step off the plane. They're on an aircraft carrier, a detail that wasn't in the old SHIELD files he remembers.

Spotting Dr. Banner, Steve greets him, though he's itching to discuss the scientist's work instead. "Dr. Banner, how's life on the run been treating you?"

Banner shrugs, a wry smile on his face. "It's been... manageable. Not the lap of luxury, but I've gotten by."

Steve nods, understanding. "I've heard about Ross's pursuit. Don't worry, I think I can pull some strings to get him off your back—and the Hulk's—after this is over."

"Hulk?" Banner raises an eyebrow. "Is that what they're calling him now?"

"You haven't seen the headlines? A lot of reports say the Hulk shielded students at Culver University from the military's crossfire," Steve explains, then catches the wary looks from Agent Romanoff and Director Fury. *Interesting. They didn't expect me to be in the loop. That tells me something about their little charade.*

Fury steps closer, his voice firm. "Dr. Banner's here for one thing: to track down the cube. Once that's done, he's out of here."

"Director Fury," Steve says with a casual grin. "Any luck tracking down Loki?"

Fury shakes his head, his gaze lingering on Banner for a moment. "Nothing yet. The cube's our best shot at finding him." With that, he strides off toward the interior of the ship.

Steve turns to see a familiar face from his first days in this new era. She exchanges a few words with Coulson, who then excuses himself.

"Agent Romanoff," Steve calls out.

She gives them a heads-up: "Gentlemen, you might want to step inside soon. It's about to get a bit harder to breathe out here."

A mechanical symphony fills the air, and Steve and Banner edge closer to see the source. Steve's keen eyes catch the rotors churning the water. "This isn't just an aircraft carrier for the sea. It's a helicarrier, meant for the sky," he blurts out, a touch of awe in his voice. He glances around, relieved to find only Banner has overheard.

Banner muses, "That's one way to handle the Hulk. Just toss me overboard."

Steve considers this. "We better head in." They pivot, following Natasha toward the bridge. "Ever tried just talking to the other guy?" Steve asks.

Banner's response is terse. "You're mistaken, Captain. The other guy's not someone you chat with—he's a monster. Perpetually angry."

Steve counters, "From what I've seen, he's not so different—aside from his looks. Seems to act mostly in self-defense."

With that, Steve breaks away, heading to the barracks. He stows his duffel, meets up with Coulson to sign the cards, and then makes his way to the bridge, ready for whatever comes next.

Agent Sitwell's announcement cuts through the hum of activity. "We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. Wait—cross-match, seventy-nine percent."

Steve frowns slightly. His understanding of machine learning tells him that's not quite how it should work. It's as if Loki is altering his appearance on the fly, each change bringing him closer to a previous version, refining their ability to track him. "Location?" Coulson's voice is clear and focused.

"Stuttgart, Germany. Twenty-eight, Königstraße. He's not exactly hiding," Sitwell responds.

Fury's gaze lands on Steve, decisive and expectant. "Captain, you're up."

---

Steve navigates the congested streets with ease, his motorcycle weaving through the traffic. He’s strategic, having Romanoff set the jet down a mile out—Loki’s enhanced senses won’t pick up on their arrival. He’s playing the long game, wanting a read on Loki before making a move. Romanoff’s on standby, ready to jump in on his cue.

He ditches the bike discreetly and vaults over an eight-foot wall, landing softly behind a tree, out of sight.

Loki’s voice carries to him, the tail end of a speech meant to subjugate. “You were made to be ruled. In the end—you will always kneel.”

An elderly German man stands, defiance in his voice. "Not to men like you." Steve prepares his shield, he might have to time it in case Loki decides to shoot. But Loki doesn't shoot. Instead he... stalls? "There are no men like me." Loki says looking around from corner of his eyes and then relying on his hearing. Steve can say that he's focusing his hearing in distance from the look on his face, that's because he has himself done so many times. But why? "There are always men like you." Loki then relaxes and Steve flinches. He knows why, he can also hear the repulsor whining in the distance. He then sees Loki timing it, every pause and word to perfection. "Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Let it be known that we-" he sees the scepter charge building up, gathering energy to shoot. And just then Iron-Man shoots a repulsor blast, landing right where Loki was standing.

Steve shakes his head. Well that told him a lot about Loki. "You can fly back here Agent Romanoff", he speaks into the comms." Steve says as he comes out from his cover.

"Make a move, Reindeer Games." He hears Tony says, and all the weapons come out of there places, pointed at Loki. At least Steve had to admit, Stark beat him on naming in this one. Reindeer Games was kind of a perfect name for current Loki.

Loki raises his hands as his Asgardian garb fades away. "Good move." Tony says.

"Hey Metal Mogul, if you are done, can we take Horns Mcgee over there under arrest?" Steve says as he comes to Tony. "You know unless you intend to fly him to prison in that suit princess style." Steve says.

"Capsicle." Tony says, as a way of greeting. And then his face scrunches up, "Metal Mogul? Really?".

"Iron Maestro was another possibility." Steve says, just to rile Stark up. "Or Stark Raving Mad?"

"Are you being sarcastic? I can't tell if you're being sarcastic." Tony asks. He looks at Loki when Steve keeps smiling. "What's wrong with this guy?" Tony asks Loki pointing at Steve.

"Give me a break, I only just killed a guy and gauged his eyeball out." Loki says, rolling his eyes and shrugging. "But that said; Captain, is there something that's wrong with you?"

Steve couldn't hold it in any longer, he burst out laughing while Tony looked on surprised at what was happening here, taking a step back.

Thankfully for Tony, the quinjet landed just then. Nat announced over the comms, which Tony had hacked into, to bring Loki in.

---

“Captain,” Tony greets, extending a hand clad in his Iron Man gauntlet.

“Dr. Stark,” Steve responds, accepting the handshake. “I’ve been reading up on Stark Industries’ work with India in Afghanistan. Iron Man might have disarmed the terrorists, but it’s Tony Stark who’s planting seeds of hope and helping their government dream of a stable future.” The weight behind Steve’s words is palpable, a clear distinction between the man and the hero.

Tony pauses, seemingly struck by the sincerity in Steve’s voice, a rarity from those outside his inner circle. But just as quickly, his public persona snaps back into place, and he replies with a practiced smile, “Safety and future tech are good business.”

Shifting gears, Tony probes, “So, Cap, what’s your secret? You’re quite agile for an older guy. Pilates?”

"Yoga and meditation every Monday and Tuesday. Pilates every Wednesday and Thursday." Steve replies, unfazed.

"What's on the long weekend."

"Oh, you know..." Steve says, wiggling his eyebrows.

Tony holds up a hand. “Stop, I don’t need the details. Haven’t had my coffee yet.”

Then Steve leans in, speaking in low voice like telling a secret. "And technically, I am only 21 years old So Dr.Stark, I am young enough to be your son." 

Tony reels back aghast. The mock horror on Tony's face is so genuine that Steve couldn't hold it in, he once again burst out laughing. But his mirth is short lived. He heard a distant rumble of Thunder and lightning. But it wasn't like any he had heard before. "Land the jet", he ordered to Agent Romanoff, shifting back into Captain mode. He had enchanced hearing and he was scientist. To him, thunder and lightning never came out of nowhere, he could usually hear the faint sizzling in air an hour before as the charge builds up close to the limits, he could usually hear the rumbling of air vortex as the Thunder develop. There was no such thing this time, it developed suddenly and was coming at them fast.

Agent Romanoff turned her head around as if to argue. "Now" he said, urgency in his voice, and that sparked Romanoff into action. The jet started lowering, fast.

"What's the matter captain?" Tony asked.

"I take it your brother won't be the one to bother with diplomacy." Captain asked Loki even as he moved towards the weapons cache, taking a SHIELD standard bow, selecting a special arrow, meant to release a bug that could be used for spying, and setting it on the bow, pointed towards the ramp.

"No, he's more the kind to barge in, go head first into a fight and take what he wants." Loki replied coming out of his meditation or sleeping trance that he was in. The thunder was audible to everyone by now.

He looked at Tony, who had his gauntlets pointing towards the ramp, repulsors charged and ready for fire. The jet landed than. And the ramp opened.

"Tony, don't shoot him the moment he comes in. Let him take Loki, I have a plan." Steve said to Tony. The moment Thor burst in, Steve’s arrow flew, its trajectory calculated to avoid Thor’s hammer yet close enough to seem a target. Thor’s reflexive swing at the arrow was part of the ruse, a feint that allowed the bug to go unnoticed as it attached to Loki’s garb.

"Agent Romanoff, can you patch into the SHIELD standard bug that was attached to that arrow?"

"Sure thing, captain."

They then heard the voices of Thor and Loki clearly.

THOR: Where is the Tesseract?

LOKI: Oh-ho, I missed you too.

THOR: Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

LOKI: Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how many dark energy did the All-Father have to muster to 
conjure you here? Your precious Earth.

They then heard the sound of hammer dropping and Thor lifting Loki. 

THOR: I thought you dead.

LOKI: Did you mourn?

THOR: We all did. Our father-

LOKI: Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

THOR: We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?

LOKI: I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I who was and should be king!

THOR: So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

LOKI: Well yes.

THOR: Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.

They then hear the sound of pushing and walking.

LOKI: I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it-

THOR: Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?

LOKI: I am a king!

THOR: Not here. You give up the Tesseract; you give up this poisonous dream! You come home.

LOKI: I don’t have it. [They then hear the sound of hammer wooshing through the air.] You need the Cube to bring me home but I’ve sent it off I know not where.

THOR: You listen well brother-

They then hear the sound of a scuffle and the connection cuts off.

"Iron Man tackled Thor and cut the conversation off." Agent Romanoff reports.

"We had gotten as much useful things as we could get out of it anyways." Steve says, as he puts his cowl back on and takes the shield. Agent Romanoff has already gotten out of her chair and put on her widow bites and he doesn't know how many other weapons. 

They ride the bike back towards the disturbance.

"Why is Tony fighting Thor?" He hears Romanoff ask as she guides the bike. "Reckless, impulsive, and not a team player" he hears her mutter.

He doesn't respond but he knows why Tony is fighting Thor. This is his first-off world encounter, and he is trying to collect data about Asgardian biology and armor using the suit while the stakes are low.

Romanoff executes a sharp drift, bringing the bike to a halt. Steve’s enhanced vision picks out Loki, perched on a hill, an observer to the chaos. “Loki’s over there, looking like he’s taking a break from mischief. You handle him. I’ve got these two,” Steve instructs.

He steps back, shield at the ready, and watches the clash of titans. Thor unleashes a bolt of lightning, striking the Iron Man suit. To Steve’s astonishment, Tony absorbs the energy, repurposing it into a powerful repulsor blast directed back at Thor.

Steve can’t help but marvel at the ingenuity, already planning to secure the footage from the SHIELD suit’s high-definition cameras to share with Peter and Ned later. It’s a moment worth revisiting, a testament to human innovation meeting otherworldly power.

Steve contemplates his next move as Tony and Thor exchange blows across a vast distance. He knows he can’t match their range, but he can certainly play to his strengths — defense. Not one to rely on uncertainties, Steve decides to communicate with Tony.

“Hey Tony, I’m not cut out for the offensive, but defense is my forte. How about I distract Thor while you come up with a plan to stop him?” Steve suggests through the comm.

A brief silence follows before a response comes. “I am Jarvis, Mr. Stark’s copilot. Sir is currently engaged in combat, so I’ve limited distractions. Your plan seems viable; I’ll inform Sir. However, please act quickly—the suit’s endurance is waning.”

“Understood, Jarvis. I’m moving in,” Steve acknowledges. He watches Thor wind up to hurl his hammer at Tony and picks up his pace, hoping he’s gauged his timing correctly.

As the hammer flies, Steve positions himself, bending his knees, leaning forward, and extending his shield. The impact is forceful, pushing him back several feet, but the pain is less than he anticipated. Thor immediately recalls his hammer, readying another strike. Steve doesn’t run away or towards the hammer; instead, he runs perpendicular to its path.

On Thor’s next throw, Steve jumps, timing it just so that instead of hitting and hurting him, the hammer takes him along for the merry ride, and since he was running across, he had managed to pick just the right line which didn't have any trees. When Thor summons the hammer back, Steve seizes the handle with his free hand. He angles his shield so that when the hammer returns to Thor’s grasp, the star on his vibranium shield connects with Thor’s temple, channeling all the kinetic energy into the blow. Thor collapses, knocked out cold. Huh, he hadn't expected that. Guess he hit a nerve.

Iron-Man lands beside Steve, his faceplate retracting to reveal a wry grin. "Huh, You knocked him out. Well, it seems like its time to wrap up the party. Who is going to carry Goldilocks the Bouncer here back to bed?"

"Yeah such a puzzle, right? I mean there are huge trenches ahead of us, and the jet is further afield. Only if we had someone with a powered suit which could fly him back." Steve replies.

"Or someone with superstrength and superendurance known for doing it all day." Tony quips back.

"I don't do it all day. Just 5 minutes in the shower." Steve replies.

"What... I am not talking about that. I am talking about your famous dialogue." Tony replies.

"What dialogue?" Steve asks, this time, genuinely confused.

"You mean you never said these words, "I could do this all day."" Tony asks.

"Nooo... Why would I ever say such an idiotic thing?" Steve asks.

"Whaaattt... You know, now I genuinely wonder if there was any truth to any of those comics people read about you." Tony said.

Just then Natasha's voice cackles over the comms. "Boys, if you are done squabbling, can you come back. I have grown bored of sitting here with Loki who wouldn't even open his eyes. Oh and one of you will have to bring the jet if you don't want me to leave Loki alone."

"J. Can you hack into the jet and bring it here?" Steve hears Tony ask. He wonders who this Jarvis guy is. He sounded rather polite and british, and copilots Tony's suit with him. And it seems like he is skilled enough to hack into SHIELD, and that too at this level.

Tony picks Thor up, bridal style.

"Sleeping Thunder." Steve finds himself saying. "What?" Tony asks. "I would have gone with the nickname Sleeping Thunder you know, from the sleeping beauty and all the lightning." 

Tony's expression changes at that. Tony was pissed, annoyed that anyone could match up with his nicknaming. He doesn't reply. He just takes off faster, leaving the smoke and soil thrown off ground from the launch as his answer.

Steve again burst out laughing.

***Asgard, 10000 BCE***

Within a grand hall of Asgard, where the floors gleamed like mirrors and the walls rose high, adorned with golden arches, stood a remarkable woman. Her skin was the color of the midnight sky, her eyes a fierce red, and she was deeply engrossed in her work. The spell she had been perfecting for a year was no ordinary one; it required rare materials from across the nine realms and beyond, all to contain the power of an infinity stone.

This woman, Bestla, was known far and wide not for her prowess in battle but for her unparalleled skill in construction. She was an architect, a builder of wonders, using magic as her tool. As she reviewed her spell one last time, her husband, Borr, approached with a meal and a reassuring smile.

"Borr," she greeted him, her voice filled with affection.

Bestla, the Jotunn queen of Asgard, donned regal attire befitting her stature. Her gown was woven from the finest threads of twilight, a fabric that captured the last glimmers of daylight and the onset of night. It flowed around her like a cascade of shadows, shimmering with a subtle iridescence that mirrored the stars above Asgard.

Upon her shoulders lay a cloak as deep blue as the deepest ocean trench, lined with the silver fur of the mythical Gullinbursti, reflecting her connection to both the celestial and the terrestrial. The cloak was clasped at her throat with a brooch shaped like the World Tree, its branches sprawling in intricate filigree, studded with gems that represented the nine realms.

Her crown was a masterwork of seidrsmithing, forged from the heart of a dying star. It arched gracefully above her brow, a circlet of interwoven metals that glowed with an inner light. Each peak of the crown bore a stone of power, an echo of the infinity stones she sought to bind.

Around her neck, Bestla wore a torque of enchanted gold, twisted and cool to the touch, a symbol of her unyielding strength. Her fingers were adorned with rings of various elements, each one a testament to the realms she oversaw and the elements she commanded.

In this attire, Bestla stood not only as a queen but as a bridge between the ancient magic of the Jotunn and the burgeoning glory of Asgard.

King Borr's presence was commanding, his stature tall and robust. His skin bore the weathered tan of a seasoned warrior, and his eyes, a piercing blue, held the depth of the oceans. His hair, the color of raven's wings, was pulled back from his face, revealing a broad forehead marked with lines of thought and care.

He wore a tunic of deep green, the color of the lush forests of Asgard, edged with intricate gold embroidery that spoke of his royal lineage. Over this, a breastplate of gleaming silver, worked with the symbols of the nine realms, protected him and proclaimed his sovereignty. His cloak, a rich burgundy, was clasped at the shoulder with a brooch bearing the emblem of the World Tree, its roots and branches intertwining in a dance of creation and destruction.

At his side hung a sword, its hilt adorned with precious stones and its blade etched with runes of power. His boots, made of sturdy leather, were designed for both ceremony and the rigors of battle. This was the attire of a king who was not only a ruler but a protector and architect of his people and their future.

"Bestla," he replied, his tone gentle and encouraging. "You've checked and rechecked. The spell is ready," he said, offering her the food.

"I just want it to be perfect," Bestla admitted, her smile reflecting a mix of anticipation and pride. "This could change everything—open up new possibilities for trade and cooperation across all realms."

"It will work," Borr stated confidently.

"If it does," Bestla continued, "it could mark the beginning of a golden age."

With a comforting embrace, Borr reassured her, "We've always made our projects succeed, Bestla. And we'll continue to create, no matter what."

Outside the hall, countless workers, both mages and builders alike, were busy shaping what would soon become a kingdom. Asgard was on the rise, not just as a home but as the foundation of an empire. Little did they know, the very people who were building it would one day be looked down upon.


---

Queen Bestla and King Borr commenced the sacred rite. Bestla, a sorceress of formidable power, possessed a magic core of immense strength, while Borr, though less versed in the arcane, could channel the potent magic of Asgard itself. Asgard's magic pulsed with a golden hue, contrasting with Bestla's own icy blue emanations. Together, they began to weave a complex tapestry of spells around the space stone, which took the form of a cube.

Surrounding materials, each more rare and precious than the last, began to fuse with the spells upon their completion. For thirty-six relentless hours, the royal couple labored without pause. Once the vast network of magic enveloping the hall was complete, they initiated the condensation process, compressing the sprawling enchantments into a singular, small cube.

As the cube shrank, it unleashed torrents of energy, radiating outwards in waves. When the final incantation settled, the space stone awoke, its activation sealing the cube with a surge of power so intense that both Bestla and Borr were cast aside. As the dust settled, they rose to find a world devoid of color, save for the gleaming blue cube that now lay before them.

"It worked," Bestla proclaimed, her smile a beacon of triumph as she regained her regal composure. Borr stood beside her, sharing in the victory. They had crafted one of the most complex artifacts of their era, a tool of untold potential. Much remained to be done: forging a stable Bifrost, granting access to other realms, ensuring the cube's peaceful use, among countless other tasks. Yet, this moment marked a beginning—a promising dawn for Asgard.

***Electron and Quantum Particles Collision Facility, Unknown Lab, New York State, 1968***

Howard took in the scene with a keen eye. The lab was buzzing with a kind of organized chaos. Scientists scurried about, their faces etched with anticipation as they put the finishing touches on the experiment. Mary was on telephone deep in conversation with engineers, giving the tunnels one final safety inspection before they could be used for accelerating electrons and other charged particles. Hank was hunched over his equipment, double-checking his setup against his hypothesis, determined to leave no room for error.

Howard was doing the same, poring over his own theories. If he was right, he'd be on the brink of uncovering a new element. Around him, a dozen other scientists were just as absorbed, all eager for that first piece of data to validate their work. Success here meant moving forward, diving deeper into specialized experiments. The lab was a who's who of industry and government bigwigs, all gathered for the big reveal.

But Howard's mind was elsewhere. He was quietly reveling in the fact that he'd kept Carter and SHIELD at bay. They would've cloaked this whole operation in secrecy, but Howard believed this discovery deserved a wider audience. Tesseract was a stroke of genius, a puzzle meant for all of humanity to solve, not something to be locked away. His efforts had paid off, bringing together scientific minds from India, Russia, China, and South Africa—a true collaboration against the odds.

Now, as the experiment teetered on the edge of history, Howard could only hope that the political and financial chips he'd cashed in would yield the breakthrough he so desperately sought.

---

***Malibu, 2010***

In his Malibu lab, Tony Stark had just finished the setup for his latest breakthrough: synthesizing a new element.

Jarvis's voice filled the room, "Initialising prismatic accelerator." Tony spun a wheel atop the device, the power climbing to its peak. With a wrench in hand, he cranked it further, inadvertently carving arcs through the wall. The beam, now honed and intense, focused on a triangular core that began to pulse with a vibrant blue light.

"That was easy," Tony quipped, removing the now-glowing triangle with a pair of pliers.

Unbeknownst to him, the palladium poisoning had clouded his observation. As the prismatic beam struck the triangle, several atoms ricocheted with such force that they embedded themselves into the nearby shield, drawn in by the unique properties of the vibranium.

---

Thor threw mjolnir at the man in the armor. But another soldier came up stood in the way with a shield. He was able to withstand the attack of the Mjolnir and stop it, Thor was impressed. He immediately summoned the Mjolnir back to throw it again but this time with full force. He could have summoned the lightning or do a more complex attack, but he wanted to see if this mortal could stand Mjolnir at full force. He saw the soldier running laterally to perform some complex maneuver. This angered Thor, a true warrior meets his foe head on. 

He threw the Mjolnir again, the mortal jumped. Instead of trying to stand the Mjolnir, he tried to use it to propel himself away. A smart move, one his little brother would have admired. Not wanting mortal to get more away than he already has, Thor summoned the Mjolnir back. 

He didn't see it coming in the dark, but he didn't bother, he was sure that Mjolnir would always come back to his hands. Then he saw the mortal coming in with Mjolnir, aiming to hit him in the temple with his shield. But Thor couldn't do anything, it was already too late, the mortal too close. Thor, caught off-guard, could only watch as the shield, topped with Starkium atoms derived from the Tesseract—Queen Bestla's ancient seidr construct—made contact with his temple. A circuit of elemental magic completed, and Thor was engulfed in a maelstrom of power. It surged within him, a tempest of lightning coursing through his very essence, not from Mjolnir, but from within his divine core.

The sensation was overwhelming, a revelation of hidden might that left him reeling. And in the climax of this newfound awakening, Thor succumbed to the sheer intensity, collapsing under the weight of his own unleashed potential.

---

"So, Capsicle, how'd you knock him out?" Tony asked, curious. Thor was still unconscious, lying on the cot in the jet. Loki also looked... curious? Intrigued? Worried? Amused? Steve couldn't say for sure.

Steve looked at Tony, slightly sheepish. "I hit him in the temple, hard. I hadn't really expected it to knock him out. Guess I really struck a nerve there."

Steve noticed a hint of green in Loki's eyes, which was hidden behind the blue as he focused on the vibranium shield. He heard him mutter—unsure if Loki was even aware of what he was saying—"The shield, it has the Tesseract's signature on it."

That confused Steve, but it provided him with another couple of pieces of the puzzle.

Steve then refocused on Tony. "So, since that was mostly luck, what were you planning to do to neutralize Thor?"

At that, Tony looked at Steve with a shark-like grin. "A reverse Faraday cage, but instead of being made of metal, it would have been made of electromagnetic fields."

Steve's mouth gaped open as he connected the dots. "The electromagnetic flux surface, it would repel any metal, not allowing the hammer to come out or break through. And the more lightning Thor summoned—"

"The more powerful the cage became."

"But it could be overloaded."

"That's where the data I gathered comes in. It would immediately release the extra energy, inside or out, depending on whether you want to hurt him or not."

"And you had enough equipment there to do that?" Steve asked.

"I would have had to tear apart the armor and repurpose it, but yes, I could," Tony said. Steve whistled at that.

While they were talking, Natasha at the front was trying to report everything that had happened to Director Fury.

---

Fury ended the call with Agent Romanoff and turned to Coulson.

"Agent Coulson," Fury acknowledged.

"Director Fury," Coulson promptly replied.

"Romanoff reported in. There was a scuffle en route; Captain America knocked Thor out."

Coulson paused, processing the news. "Was Thor trying to free Loki?"

"No, he was interrogating him. We've got the recording, thanks to Romanoff," Fury explained. "Stark provoked Thor, and Rogers had to step in. He managed to knock Thor out cold."

Coulson mulled it over. "Thor's not one for planning or teamwork; he probably just swooped in and snatched Loki."

"Exactly," confirmed Fury.

"They're bringing Thor in, then?"

"That's right."

"We've got two choices: lock Thor up with Loki or bring in Jane Foster," Coulson stated.

Fury's expression tightened. "Romanoff thinks we should go with the first option."

"That's a no-go. Thor will call for his hammer as soon as he's up, and that could tear this place apart. Plus, he's not exactly the type to talk things out. If we put him in that cell, he'll be out and falling in under a minute."

"Jane Foster is a civilian, and the Helicarrier's security is already shaky."

"We might not have a choice, sir. If we don't want Thor turning on us, we need Foster here before he comes to," Coulson insisted.

---

The Quinjet touched down on the Helicarrier's deck. Agents quickly scrambled to escort Thor to the infirmary, while Tony jetted off to the other side to shed his Iron Man suit.

Joining him was Agent Romanoff, and as they made their way to the bridge, she couldn't help but remark, "You and Stark seemed pretty cozy back there."

Steve, only mildly taken aback, had his suspicions. He'd read the file, knew who authored it, but what he couldn't pin down was Romanoff's angle. Was she playing him, or did she truly buy into her own words? Did Fury send her, knowing she'd misread Stark, or was that report crafted under orders? Time to probe a little.

"Why wouldn't we get along? Dr. Stark's a genuinely nice guy," Steve offered, feigning naivety.

Romanoff let out a derisive snort. "You don't actually believe that, do you?"

Steve halted, turning to face her with a look of sincere curiosity. "Why wouldn't I?"

"Stark is selfish, entitled, reckless, arrogant, and impulsive. He's not team material," Romanoff countered. "Believe me, I know Stark. I profiled him, was his 'assistant' for a week." She said 'assistant' with a tinge of disdain. "He only ever fights for himself."

"That's not true," Steve pushed back. "I had my doubts too, after reading your file and watching SHIELD's briefing," he lied; he'd never doubted Stark. "But then I saw the news. You could argue that Stark cleared the weapons from Afghanistan out of revenge against the Ten Rings. But he didn't stop there. He got Stark Industries to work with India in Afghanistan, set up checkpoints to block new weapons from entering, ensured the UN delivered food aid, and rooted out government corruption. He even got the US military to pull out. He went above and beyond, not just passing the buck. He didn't have to do any of that, but he did."

"All for show. Just so he can strut in front of the media," Agent Romanoff retorts.

"It doesn't matter why he did it, though I'd argue that's not his motive. What's important is that his actions have improved the lives of millions," Steve counters, noticing Romanoff's expression shift to an unreadable mask. He's struck a nerve. "That's the real issue, isn't it? That's why you wrote the report. Everything seems to come effortlessly to Tony. You've been training since you were three, excelling beyond anyone else, fighting your way out of an organization that enslaved you. You've worked tirelessly here, yet you're still unsure if you've made a real difference. Meanwhile, Tony has made a significant impact with just a phone call."

"All your training wouldn't have been enough to escape if you were captured by a group like the Ten Rings. It would've taken you a decade of maneuvering. It took you a decade to break free from the Red Room after turning eighteen. And Tony? He escaped in three months with shrapnel in his heart and a car battery strapped to his chest," Steve continues, bewildered. "You didn't write that report because you think Tony is selfish or ill-intentioned. Deep down, you know what he's capable of. You wrote it because you feel threatened by him."

"You've spent twenty years trying to wipe the red from your ledger, and Tony managed to do something similar in less than a year," Steve concludes, turning to head towards the bridge, leaving Romanoff stunned in the hallway. He wanted to bring up the Palladium issue, but he couldn't let on that he was aware of it.

---

Steve strides onto the bridge just in time to catch Fury and Loki's exchange on the screen. "Ant," Fury says, gesturing towards Loki, then points to a panel, "Boot."

Loki smiles, unfazed. "It's an impressive cage. Not built for me, I think."

Steve can't help but cover his mouth with his hand. *Of course, it's not built for him. The guy can teleport; it wouldn't hold him.*

"Built for something a lot stronger than you," Fury shoots back. Steve thinks to himself, *If Fury's arrogance wasn't clear before, it sure is now. The man can't spot a hint if it's right under his nose.*

"Oh, I've heard..." Loki trails off, turning to face a camera.

"A mindless beast—pretends he's still a man..." Steve overhears and glances at Banner, recalling the hallway encounter. Loki had been eyeing Banner with a knowing smile, as if plotting something.

"...how desperate are you to call on such lost creatures to defend you?"

"How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war, you steal a force you can't hope to control, you talk about peace and you kill for fun. You've made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did."

Steve can't help but question Fury's assumption. Was it not arrogant to think Loki couldn't control the cube? After all, the man had used it to travel billions of miles to Earth. Steve knows better; he's aware that Loki can indeed control the cube. He's just thankful that Loki is on their side and that the opposition remains oblivious to the full extent of Loki's mastery over the cube.
"Ooh. It must burn you to have come so close—to have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power, and for what? A warm light for all mankind to share?" Steve mulls over the situation. Stark Tower is indeed Loki's play. He wonders how it's not obvious to everyone that Loki is on their side. If he weren't so concerned about revealing his thoughts, he'd voice it out loud.

"And then to be reminded what real power is," Loki adds with a smirk.

"Well, let me know if 'real power' wants a magazine or something," Fury retorts. Steve watches Fury turn away, thinking to himself, *The man's a complete bullshitter.* He had hoped Fury was more astute. Predictable moves are easier to counter, and you don't want the other side making rash decisions that could backfire on everyone.

"He really grows on you, doesn't he?" Banner remarks.

Steve isn't sure if Banner's being sarcastic or if he's genuinely frightened, but he'd bet on the latter.

"No, he doesn't," Steve responds. "He's targeting you specifically, Dr. Banner."

"What do you mean?" Banner asks, a mix of curiosity and defensiveness in his voice.

"It means he's trying to get under your skin, make you angry," Steve explains. Before Banner can respond, he continues, "Not because he thinks it'll be enough to turn you into the Hulk. But so that when he triggers something—and he will—to activate your self-preservation instincts, the Hulk won't be willing to listen."

Banner stares at him, taken aback. "And how did you come to such a wild conclusion?"

"Have you seen the footage of Loki's arrival on Earth, Dr. Banner?" Steve inquired.

"Yes, I have," Banner confirmed.

"Let me show you something," Steve said, picking up a nearby tablet. He pulled up the footage, scrolled to the right moment, and paused the video. "See here? That's Agent Barton. In his 25-year career, he's never missed a shot. Now watch what happens when he aims at Fury."

Banner leaned in. "He's a top-notch sniper. From this close, it looks like he deliberately missed."

"Exactly," Steve affirmed. "It suggests the Scepter's control isn't absolute. Loki has SHIELD's best agents at his disposal, capable of freeing him from any facility, yet they can't be trusted to destroy it or take lives."

"That's where I come into play. If they attack us and hit just the right spot, they'll inadvertently trigger the Hulk. That won't bode well for anyone here, especially if I'm in the lab," Bruce mused, eyeing the lab's precarious location. "Whoever designed this had no sense of military strategy, did they?"

"Nope, not at all," Steve agreed with a smile.

"So, what now?" Bruce pondered.

"You could move to a different facility, somewhere Loki isn't, or you could try talking to the Hulk," Steve suggested.

Bruce's gaze sharpened. "You really believe that's possible?"

"I do," Steve nodded.

Just as they seemed to be making headway, Agent Hill interjected. "Dr. Banner, can you tell us what Loki needs the Iridium for?" she asked. Romanoff also stepped in, eager for some insights.

"It's a stabilizing agent," Tony announced as he approached, "which means the portal won't collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. It also means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants."

Tony then turned to the SHIELD personnel. "Ah, raise the mizzenmast, ship the topsails." The personnel gave him a puzzled look. Steve suppressed a smile; the ship's design was indeed archaic. Tony had just mocked it, and no one who might be offended caught on. "That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did." So that was the harmonic tone Steve had been hearing. *Damn.* Now it would be stuck in his head. Enhanced hearing and his serum-charged brain could be a curse for remembering such things. Standing at the command area, Tony covered one eye and asked Hill, "How does Fury even see these?" Steve struggled to contain his laughter; the design was laughably bad.

"He turns," Hill replied, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

"Sounds exhausting!" Tony quipped. He began tampering with the screens, attaching something under a desk. *Smoke and mirrors,* the age-old game. Steve was beginning to appreciate Tony's style. "The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can easily acquire. The only major component he still needs is a power source with high energy density. Something to... kickstart the Cube."

"Would the Arc Reactor at Stark Tower suffice as the power source?" Steve interjected before Hill could speak up.

"Yes, it would," Dr. Banner chimed in. "It's perfect. Dr. Selvig wouldn't even have to worry about stabilizing the quantum tunneling effect to break the Coulomb barrier."

"Finally, someone who speaks English," Tony exclaimed. Stark and Banner shook hands. "It's good to meet you, Doctor Banner," Tony said. "Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of how you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster."

"...Thanks," Banner replied, somewhat taken aback.

Fury strides in, and of course, just as the conversation was getting somewhere, another interruption from SHIELD. Steve nearly moved to intercept him upon his entrance.

"Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube," Fury begins, then pauses, likely recalibrating his tone for the usual posturing. Steve cuts in before Fury can continue. "We've already located it, Director. The cube will be at Stark Tower. We just need to lay low, wait for them to show up, and then we take them by surprise."

Steve catches the twitch in Fury's eye, a sight he's grown weary of. Which dumb f*cker wrote that he could do this all day?

"Nice work, Captain," Fury concedes.

"It was teamwork," Steve replies with an innocent smile, though he's itching to give Fury more than just a piece of his mind.

"Good idea, Captain," Tony chimes in, turning to Steve with a mischievous grin before resuming a neutral expression to address Fury. "All SHIELD needs to do is fill me in on their backdoors. I'll set the traps, and we'll know the moment they step in."

Steve fights back another smile. Tony could undoubtedly uncover the backdoors himself, but getting SHIELD to divulge them is another game entirely. *My cheeks are going to be sore from controlling all the smiles.*

The room falls into a tense silence as Fury regains his composure. "Agent Romanoff, escort Stark to our cyber division. Give him level 12 access to all the backdoors," he orders. Steve silently bets that SHIELD might lose a few good coders to Stark Industries after this—if they have any to begin with.

Dr. Banner steps forward. "Director, there's something else. It seems Loki plans to use me for his escape. I think either he or I should be moved to a different facility."

"We don't have another facility capable of containing Loki or you," Fury responds evenly.

Banner looks ready to argue, but Steve decides to step away from the fray. He has other matters to attend to. First, he attempts to don his cowl, hoping to reconnect with Mr. Jarvis. It would certainly make things easier for him.

"Hello, Mr. Jarvis, can you hear me?" Steve asked, half-expecting silence.

"I can hear you, Captain Rogers," came Jarvis's prompt reply, to Steve's surprise. Either Jarvis was always connected, or there was some sort of recognition software at play. Either way, Steve was relieved.

"Is this line secure?"

"Not yet. Head straight, take the first right, then the third left," Jarvis instructed. *Ah, right,* Steve thought, recalling Tony's tinkering with the center console. It made sense that Jarvis would be on the other end, orchestrating the hack.

Following Jarvis's directions, Steve found himself in a neglected corner of the ship, seemingly overlooked by surveillance and unfinished in its construction. It was perfect for his needs.

"Mr. Jarvis, I need a favor," Steve began.

"How can I assist you, Captain Rogers?"

"I need to send a message to a friend, discreetly," Steve explained.

"Provide me with the number and the message, and I will ensure its delivery," Jarvis offered.

"Okay, here's the number..." Steve relayed the details.

"Send this message: 'Hey RC, Stevie here. Location: Stark Tower, New York. Alien invasion likely within the next 12 hours.'" Steve spoke with a sense of urgency, aware that despite their plans, thwarting the invasion might be out of their hands. If Loki wanted it to happen, it would—especially since he seemed intent on New York as the stage.

"Message sent, Captain Rogers."

"Thank you, Mr. Jarvis. I owe you one," Steve expressed his gratitude, then added, "And please, call me Steve or Mr. Rogers." If he was placing his trust in Tony and his digital confidant, formalities could be set aside. "The 'Captain' title was just a PR move."

"Understood, Mr. Rogers," Jarvis responded. "You should also know that Mr. Odinson has awakened."

"Thanks again, Mr. Jarvis," Steve said, removing his cowl. He planned to check on Thor, but having this information gave him a clear next step.

Steve's journey to the infirmary was interrupted by Agent Coulson's approach.

"Captain," Coulson greeted with a reverence that bordered on awe.

"Agent Coulson," Steve replied, his smile a thin veil over his concern. *Damn*, he thought, his hope of an unnoticed passage dashed.

"You've become quite the legend here, Captain," Coulson remarked, his eyes alight with the excitement of a child recounting tales of their idol. Steve felt a pang of guilt at that, it seems that not everyone here was in on the whole torture, manipulation and end justifies the means act. 80-90% of them were, he was sure about that. "A lot of people here had heard or read about you, but hearing about you knocking out Thor just made them realize that you are the real deal."

Steve deflected, "It was more luck than skill, Agent." His mind raced. Visibility meant vulnerability. His calculated displays of intelligence had been for select eyes only, ensuring no witnesses. Romanoff, with her towering ego and deep-seated insecurities, wouldn't divulge his strategies. But now, every move would be scrutinized. He silently thanked Jarvis for the clandestine assistance. Being caught mid-hack was a scenario best left unimagined.

"Luck favors the prepared, Captain," Coulson quipped before continuing on his path.

Steve navigated to the infirmary without further delay.

"Dr. Foster," he greeted, masking his surprise. SHIELD's involvement with her was logical, yet it irked him. Meeting the brightest minds as nothing more than a soldier was not the impression he wished to leave.

As he turned to Thor, propped up in bed, he offered a respectful, "Prince Thor."

"Captain," Thor responded, followed by Dr. Foster's curious, "Captain America?"

"Not quite," Steve addressed her briefly before refocusing on Thor. "My apologies for last night's incident. It was unintended."

"Apologies are unnecessary, Captain. Your prowess in battle is undeniable," Thor intoned, his voice lacking the expected thunderous quality. Steve pondered this anomaly; how had he anticipated the voice of a man he'd never encountered?

"I need to discuss a matter of importance with you, Prince Thor," Steve stated.

"Concerning Loki?" Thor surmised.

"Partially," Steve conceded. Without preamble, he presented the tablet, playing the footage of Loki's arrival on Earth. Dr. Foster and Thor leaned in, their expressions shifting from curiosity to dismay. "This is Loki's first descent," Steve explained.

Thor's features contorted, not with anger, but with a dawning dread. "This cannot be my brother," he murmured, his plea evident in his gaze.

Steve remained silent, allowing Thor's observations to hang in the air.

"He lacks any semblance of his usual composure. His visage is gaunt, as though sustenance has been a stranger to him for ages," Thor described, his voice laced with concern. "And his attempts at concealment through glamour are feeble. Even with my limited knowledge of seidr, the facade is transparent."

"Thor, I suspect your brother is under the influence of the scepter," Steve proposed, presenting a high-resolution image of Loki's eyes on the tablet.

"No, it's impossible," Thor protested, shaking his head vehemently. "After an ordeal in our youth, Loki fortified his mind with defenses so impenetrable, they were deemed unassailable across all nine realms."

"And how does one dismantle such a stronghold?" Steve inquired.

A pained realization dawned on Thor. "The process would have been barbaric," he acknowledged. "For Loki to endure the abyss and emerge with his sanity intact was nothing short of miraculous. To then suffer such cruelty..." Thor's voice trailed off, horror etched into his features.

Steve handed over the tablet, displaying the haunting image of Loki's cerulean eyes. The undeniable evidence brought Thor to the brink of tears. Steve's heart weighed heavy with guilt, witnessing the god's anguish, yet he knew the revelation was necessary. Loki's plight demanded Thor's understanding.

"Oh-ho," Thor murmured, echoing Loki's initial utterance. Steve observed the confusion etched on Thor's face, recognizing it as a distress signal shared between the brothers. "It's a palindrome," Thor explained, his voice breaking. "A sign that all was not well." He had overlooked the simplicity of the word amidst Loki's typically elaborate lexicon. Now, Thor found solace in Jane's embrace, his sobs a testament to his fraternal bond.

Steve harbored a desire to step away, to grant them a moment of privacy, yet pressing questions tethered him to the spot. "Thor, the Tesseract, it was crafted by Queen Bestla, wasn't it?" he inquired with purpose.

"Aye, she is of my lineage," Thor confirmed, pride resonating in his tone. "Her and King Borr's legends echo across the nine realms."

"Then logic dictates that any scion of the Royal Family could wield it," Steve deduced aloud, more a statement of fact than a question.

"Whither are you steering this discourse, Captain?" Thor queried, a furrow of curiosity marking his brow.

"The prevailing theory contends that Loki lacks the means to command the Tesseract independently, necessitating an apparatus of sorts. Yet, if it is indeed Queen Bestla's legacy, would not his seidr suffice?" Steve posited.

A contemplative silence enveloped them. Thor, lost in thought, finally nodded in assent. "Aye, the Queen and King are venerated for their flawless creations. The Tesseract, a regal relic, should indeed bend to the will anyone on the royal list through mere seidr." A cascade of realizations washed over Thor, his countenance shifting from sorrow to an amalgam of reverence, respect, love, and a burgeoning hope. "The scepter's dominion—it is not absolute, is it? Loki's actions are subversive; he's undermining the incursion."

Steve's nod was a silent acknowledgment of the puzzle pieces falling into place. Thor's self-realization, prompted by Steve's subtle nudges, brought a fleeting sense of relief. But the respite was short-lived.

As Steve turned to leave, granting them a private moment, Agent Coulson burst in. "Captain Rogers, Dr. Banner is on the verge of leaping from the helicarrier." Almost simultaneously, Agent Romanoff reported, "Dr. Selvig and his team have infiltrated Stark Tower."

Steve processed the information swiftly. Stark would manage the latter; his concern lay with the former. He honed his senses, isolating Dr. Banner's distinct heartbeat amidst the chaos, and dashed out.

En route, Commander Hill's voice crackled over the comm, relaying to Director Fury, "Loki has vanished with the Scepter—teleportation, it seems." Steve's heart sank; events were unfolding faster than anticipated. He hoped Matt had evacuated New York.

"Dr. Banner!" Steve called out, his voice cutting through the wind as he emerged outside. Banner paused, turning—a silent, somber farewell in his gaze. Steve quickened his pace.

"I pose a threat to all aboard, Captain Rogers," Banner confessed.

"Did Director Fury deny your request to disembark?" Steve probed. God, ten minutes with Thor and he was already turning shakepearean.

Affirmation came with a nod.

"And conversing with 'the other guy' wasn't an option?" Steve pressed.

"IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT," Banner retorted, his tone teetering on the edge of transformation.

"Understood," Steve conceded, stepping back. "There's no need for drastic measures. Loki has fled, scepter in hand."

"How? When?" Banner's suspicion was evident.

"Teleportation, apparently," Steve explained.

Banner's tension ebbed away, and he retreated from the precipice.

"We're heading to New York. Stark's already en route. Will you join us?" Steve extended the invitation. "Your assistance would be invaluable, though I'll respect your decision either way."

Banner hesitated, the internal struggle clear in his furrowed brow—confrontation was not his nature.

After a moment's contemplation, Banner acquiesced. "I'll come."

Steve recognized the gravity of Banner's trust and silently vowed to shield him from any who might exploit his vulnerability.
